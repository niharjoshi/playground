Takeaways: My interview itself was pretty short but it was the longest amongst the ones that heard. Almost everyone else was just asked the same 3 questions: undergraduate, father's profession, father's income. That's all. They key is confidence and conciseness.
There were two other VOs who were taking time with the interviews but as long as you have sufficient funding and  nothing suspicious in your profile, you should be good.

Tips: 

* Try to be as calm as possible. Just keep in mind that being anxious or nervous will never help.
* Formals are not mandatory but i personally feel it makes you more confident.
* Listen to the question being asked by the VO properly and then answer. Dont be in a haste to get the interview done with.
* Do attend as many mock interviews as you can and keep practicing the questions. Practice is the only thing that can give you the confidence you need for the interview.
* The process is actually pretty simple and breezy. They just want to know some information about you, thats it.

There were just 3 or 4 counters open and the other counters were taking time for the interviews. Only this VO was blazing through F1 interviews. Approved 4 F1s back to back within a span of 3 minutes or maybe even less. Did not even ask why this course if you changed streams. One guy in front of me was a Mechanical Engineering graduate and was going for MS in CS. No change of stream questions asked. 

One positive thing to note is that even though the other VOs we‚Äôre taking their time, I couldn‚Äôt see any F1s getting rejected.
