Counter No: 32 (bald young guy)
http://t.me/f1interviewreviews

(I didn't want the bald guy as he only asked about father's details. My father's income is less. Wanted to mention my family income. Anyway it got approved, so thankful to the guy. :D) 

Me: Hello sir, Good morning. 
VO: Good morning! Your documents please (they announced earlier to keep our Sevis receipt, I20 and passport ready)

VO: how much savings he has? 
Me: Parents - 16L, Personal - 23L. 

VO: Loan? 
Me: Yes I have a loan too of 35L.

VO: (looks into his computer, keeps doing something. He did typing for around 3 mins.. I got scared, because for others, it didn't took more than 30 secs, whereas I was on counter for 3 mins now. One of the possibilities is that he was checking details about my brother who is in US on h1b visa. I also got worried thinking that the income was low. After some time, passes me the white slip) 

VO: Your visa is approved
Me: Thank you so much. 

Takeaways :
1. Don't stress much. 
2. Be prepared to wait for 1 - 2 hours.
3. You can deposit your phone on the kiosk as soon as you enter the gate after getting your passport sticker marked. They charged 50rs for 1 mobile. 
4. Funny but there were some rickshaw wallas who were selling umbrellas outside the gate on opposite road. Pretty helpful for people who forgot to carry one. 

PS:
I know its been difficult for all of us because of the pandemic. First deferring admits, waiting for a year and then struggling for slots  because of the second wave. Keep hanging there, keep hustling. Its difficult to be patient at such times. But this too shall pass. We all will go to US.

Thank you to the admins who are running this channel, and to people who submit their experiences. This has been of great help :)

Note : Lockers are available for biometrics for Rs.100 but not for interview. 
During the interview, the guy in front of me was unable to explain how he had the savings when his father's income was low. The VO gave 2 chances to explain but he was stammering. The VO told him that he had only 1 more chance to answer the question and if the VO wasn't satisfied he would reject the visa. The guy answered something else and finally the VO approved his visa. 

Just be confident and don't stammer. Keep your answers short, crisp and to the point.

I stayed in US for 4 years on H4 visa and I mentioned that in the ds160 as well but this particular VO didn't ask anything about that.

Counter no. 32

Tips: 

* Try to be as calm as possible. Just keep in mind that being anxious or nervous will never help.
* Formals are not mandatory, so i went in semi formals no tuck too.

* Listen to the question being asked by the VO properly and then answer. Dont be in a haste to get the interview done with.

* Do attend as many mock interviews as you can and keep practicing the questions. Practice is the only thing that can give you the confidence you need for the interview.
* The process is actually pretty simple and breezy. They just want to know some information about you, thats it.

Opinion:
Don't go early unless you like to wait. If you reach 10-15 mins before you'll get in without having to wait at all. You'll just have to wait in the line inside the consulate. If you reach 35-40 mins early you might have to wait till they call for your slot. Don't arrive more than 30 mins before your scheduled time.

I got the Bald Guy and I was overjoyed by that. 😂 

He was approving student visas in like 10 secs flat for each applicant. 

A girl in front of me visited the counter and he took her interview for about 3-4 mins. (*Including a 1 min awkward silence*) I got a little bit tensed up as the other counters started seeming faster suddenly. She ultimately got rejected due to inconsistencies of sibling information in the DS160 and the Interview responses.

(*VO asks me to come forward*)
Me: Good Morning, Officer.
VO: Good Morning, please pass me your passport
(*Passed*)
VO:  Pass me your i20 too.
Me: Here you go, officer. (*Passed*)
VO: What does your father do?
Me: Told. (*Interrupts in between by asking the next question and hence could not hear it*)
Me: Sorry officer, Couldn't quite catch that

(*Placed*)
VO: Your visa is approved.
(*Passed me white slip and I-20*)

VO: Please pass me your passport
Me: *passed passport* Good morning, officer
VO: Pass me your I-20
Me: *passed I-20*
VO: What does your father do?
Me: My father is a retired government official. Retired since 15 years
VO: *raised his eyebrows and nodded* What was his income before retirement?
Me: Rs. XX
VO: And savings?
Me: Rs. XX in savings accounts and Rs. XX in fixed deposits
VO: Where did these savings originally come from?
Me: So after his retirement, my father received a Provident Fund and Gratuity worth Rs. XX and (VO interrupted)
VO: And the rest of it?
Me: My father has been receiving a pension of Rs. XX every year, since the past 15 years and (VO interrupted)
VO: Okay, okay! I'm approving your visa. Place your right hand four fingers on the scanner
Me: Thank you, officer
VO: No worries! It's my pleasure

Situation:
1. The security was letting people having slots up to 11:00 AM inside at 8:45 AM
2. 4 counters were open. 27, 29, 31, 33
3. Around this time, counters 29 and 31 were occupied by B1/B2 applicants (couples with small kids) and their interview was going on for over 20 minutes over the respective counters. Only counters 27 and 33 were available for F1 visas during those 20 odd minutes
4. A girl was rejected at counter 33 while I was in the queue. Couldn't hear much, but her funding seemed to have 3 to 4 sponsors along with a loan
5. The bald VO was at counter 27 today. He rejected a guy 2 seats ahead of me. The guy was previously rejected as well, and when he was asked how his situation has changed since his previous application, his answers didn't satisfy the VO and instead he got a stern reply and a visa reject
6. The bald VO is very quick! I think he approved 15-20 people within the 10 minutes I was inside the interview area

Takeaways:
1. Most people are getting approved. As long as you have decent savings, and an overall decent profile with no negative history, you'll breeze through it!
2. Be honest and concise with your answers, especially with the famous bald VO. He is very clear with what he wants and is very experienced. Trying to beat around the bush or being evasive to what he asked will only get you into trouble. Also, please keep a justification ready for everything you say, from income to savings. Good luck!
